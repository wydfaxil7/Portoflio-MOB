<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **[How did you approach organizing your design files and components within Figma to maintain efficiency and ease of collaboration?]**

  - [Regarding organization within Figma: "I prioritize a systematic approach to organizing design files by creating clear naming conventions, utilizing Figma's components and styles features extensively, and structuring frames and pages logically. This helps streamline collaboration and ensures consistency across projects."]

- **[Can you provide insights into your design process, including any specific plugins or resources you found particularly helpful during the creation of these projects?]**

  - [Regarding design process and helpful resources: "My design process typically involves initial research and ideation, followed by wireframing and prototyping directly within Figma. I find plugins like Stark for accessibility checks and Unsplash for quick access to high-quality images incredibly useful. Additionally, Figma's built-in collaboration features enable seamless communication and feedback exchange with team members."]
